  <h1>Additional Challenges</h1>
  <p>You now know the basics of how Stripe transactions are created via two separate HTTP requests. We hope you enjoyed this tutorial!</p>
  <p>The cool thing about Stripe's test API is that it works exactly the same as the real API. The only difference is that you switch the API keys to the real ones, and you server your app over HTTPS instead of HTTP.</p>
  <p>From here, you might experiment with the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Refactoring the app into more than one page with a more natural flow that doesn't depend on AJAX as much.</p>
    <li>Setting your app up to use HTTPS (required if you plan to use the Stripe API for real)</li>
    <li>Creating Stripe customers</li>
    <li>Storing Stripe customer IDs in your database, associating them with usernames</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Best wishes for all of your Stripe adventures. &hearts;</p>
